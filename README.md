# Fine-Tuning Transformers with On-Device GPU Resources

In this notebook, I'll walk you through fine-tuning the transformer model for a summarization task locally, specifically on a GPU NVIDIA RTX A5000-powered HP ZBook Fury.

**The Importance of Summarization in NLP:**  
Summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial task due to its applications in research and business. It addresses the issue of information overload and enhances time efficiency by distilling long documents into their essence.

**Transformer Models - The Backbone of Generative AI:**  
Transformer model is a type of generative AI. They can generate new content based on the input they receive. This architecture is behind many well-known AI models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and others, which, besides the summarization,  are capable of generating text, answering questions, and more.

**Why Local GPU?**  
Choosing between a local GPU and a cloud service depends on factors like performance needs, data privacy concerns, cost, internet stability, and the nature of your work. For many professionals and researchers, the advantages of a local GPU make it a preferred choice for demanding computational tasks.
